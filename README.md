## **PinTogether**

Web3 game running on polygon and ipfs/filecoin

We listened to the judges who participated in the Hackathon competition and included a very preliminary economic model in this update.

We know that economic models represent the flow and distribution of benefits, and people recognize benefits as valuable for two reasons, either because they generate money or because they satisfy psychological needs. The former corresponds to the Defi and the latter to GameFi.

StepN has done a good exploration in Defi. After research, we believe that GameFi is actually more suitable for LBS, because there are already successful web2 LBS games (such as Pokemon Go) in the industry, but no on web3.

During the design process, we investigated several classic game economy models, such as EVE, New world and Menghuanxiyou, and set the most basic output for PinTogether, we call it AP(Active point). It is generated when a user punch in at block of the map.

A user could pay APs to build Landmark store(smart contract) , the store could offer Pieces in the format of NFT. Pieces are minted(and burned) according to bounding-curve model, which is set in the Landmark contract when it is deployed.

### **techology**

- **IPFS**
We use ipfs infrustructure for storing nft and another data interactive with our platform

- **EVM contract**
We deployed contract on the polygon network

### Next Step

Design AP cycles(produce and comsume) in PinTogether with reasonable numbers/variables, so that a basic game flow could be built.
